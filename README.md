# Game Prototypes

A collection of prototypes created for fun and learning.

## Goals
- Learn new things (languages, tech, etc)
- Produce fun, or at least attempt to produce fun
- Try out different ideas, and get used to working through the idea to make some thing work
- Postmortem the prototype to find things that were liked and disliked, to feedback into future attempts

## Rules
- Four weeks per prototype
- Use a different framework after no more than two prototypes
- Try to avoid repeating game ideas too often
