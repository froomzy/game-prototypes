# Game Prototypes

A collection of prototypes created for fun and learning.

## Goals
- Learn new things (languages, tech, etc)
- Produce fun, or at least attempt to produce fun
- Try out different ideas, and get used to working through the idea to make some thing work
- Postmortem the prototype to find things that were liked and disliked, to feedback into future attempts

## Rules
- Four weeks per prototype

  By the end of the first week there should be a plan of what the prototype will be, including what the visual assets will be, what framework will be used, and a plan of how to get done.
- Pick a primary visual asset pack from KennyNL, and at most one supporting set.

  The assets should be driving the process. They will help with coming up an idea, and getting the visual out of the way should simplify design.
- Use a different framework after no more than two prototypes

  Using the same framework over and over will not give opportunities to learn new techs. Changing after two prototypes gives a couple of chances to get to know it and get more comfortable with how it works.
- Try to avoid repeating game ideas too often
